        For example you might have a component that relies on Windows or Linux system calls, so it can be helpful to
        separate them with a folder. Similarly a database implementation built on top of Postgres and MongoDB might end
        up in different files or folders.

        Separating things by dependency often makes it easier to do compilation where you don’t pull in a particular
        dependency. Similarly, separating by dependency allows you to focus more on the “abstraction” that the different
        dependencies need to implement.

        Grouping by team makes it clearer when coordination between teams is needed. For example ui, backend and db need
        expertise from different teams. Hence, it becomes more obvious who is responsible for which part of the
        codebase.

        However such separation can break locality of information of how something works. Locality of information itself
        can make harder to grasp the system as a whole. The isolation itself may result in ui, backend and db not
        fitting
        together nicely.
